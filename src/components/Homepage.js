            <Paragraph>
                Shiatsu is a traditional form of therapy from Japan. 
                Shiatsu shares the same roots as Chinese Acupuncture, both originating from the Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM). 
                Shiatsu is known for its healing power without the use of medication. 
                According to the Traditional Chinese Medicine, the physical and psychological symptoms arising in the human body, are the source of an unbalance of the energy flow in our body. 
                By balancing the flow of energy in the meridians, Shiatsu can relieve many conditions, help prevent the build-up of stress, and restore vitality and well-being. 
                Literally translated as "finger pressure", Shiatsu uses comfortable pressure from the thumbs and palms applied to to the energy channels and acupressure points in the body. 
                Gentle stretches and rotations of the limbs and joints may as well be included.
